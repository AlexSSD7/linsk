# Linsk Windows usage instructions

In this document, you will find instructions on how to get started using Linsk on Windows.

# How Linsk works
As you probably have realized from the initial README, Linsk takes use of a lightweight Alpine Linux virtual machine to tap into the rich world of Linux filesystems.

Linsk will pass through the disk as a raw block device to an ephemeral virtual machine, set up a file share, and then expose it to your host computer, along with logging the file share connection details. It's as simple as that.

# Use Linsk

## Step 0. The first-time Linsk initialization

To use Linsk, you will need to build a virtual machine image to use. Doing this is as easy as running the following command:
```powershell
linsk build
```

This will take a minute or two. This is what you will see:
```

```

**NOTE:** Building a VM image requires an internet connection. After the initial image build is done, you can use Linsk offline.

## Step 1. Select the drive you want to pass through

Find the path of the physical drive you want to pass through by executing the following command:
```powershell
wmic diskdrive list brief
```

Find your disk, and take note of the disk path that looks like `\\.\PhysicalDriveX` (where X is a number). We will need this in the next step.

**IMPORTANT NOTE:** Please ensure that the physical device you are trying to pass through is not mounted anywhere else on the host machine. Otherwise, you run serious risks. No further warnings will be issued.

## Step 2. Use `linsk ls` to see what partitions are available in the VM

Run `linsk ls` while specifying the block device path you obtained in the previous step:
```powershell
# This should be run in a terminal open with administrator privileges.
linsk ls dev:\\.\PhysicalDriveX
```

You will then see something like this:
```
# linsk command output

```

Filtering the logs out, this is the point of your interest:
```

vda                  1G

  ├─vghdd-archive    3T crypto_LUKS
  └─vghdd-media    2.5T xfs
```

This is an output of `lsblk` command Linsk ran for you under the VM's hood.

You should ignore `vda` drive as this is the system drive you have the Alpine Linux installation on. Assuming that you used raw device passthrough, commonly, `vdb` is going to be the drive you passed through. But please note that this may not always be the case, and you should inspect the output above and confirm that the partitions shown match your drive.

## Step 3. Run Linsk

Let's assume that we decided to run Linsk with the `vdb2` volume we found in the previous step. To do so, you may execute the following command:

```powershell
# This should be run in a terminal open with administrator privileges.
linsk run dev:\\.\PhysicalDriveX vdb2
```

Explanation of the command above:
- `dev:\\.\PhysicalDriveX` - Tell Linsk to pass through the drive path you obtained from step 1.
- `vdb2` - Tell Linsk to mount `/dev/vdb2` inside the filesystem. This was gathered from step 2.

Upon running, you will see logs similar to this in your terminal:
```
# linsk command output
time=2023-09-03T10:53:57.385+01:00 level=WARN msg="Using raw block device passthrough. Please note that it's YOUR responsibility to ensure that no device is mounted in your OS and the VM at the same time. Otherwise, you run serious risks. No further warnings will be issued." caller=vm

time=2023-09-03T10:54:12.363+01:00 level=INFO msg="Started the network share successfully" backend=smb
===========================
[Network File Share Config]
The network file share was started. Please use the credentials below to connect to the file server.

Type: SMB
URL: \\fe8f-5980-3253-7df4-f4b-6db1-5d59-bc77.ipv6-literal.net\linsk
Username: linsk
Password: <random password>
===========================
```

At this point, you can open the file explorer -> Right-click "This PC" -> Show more options (if you're on Windows 11) -> Map network drive. Afterward, you should specify the share URL (the one that starts with `\\`), the static `linsk` username, and a randomly generated password.

**That's it!** After that, you should see the network share mounted successfully. That means that you can now access the files on the `vdb2` volume right from your Mac.

The network share will remain open until you close Linsk, which you can do at any time by hitting Ctrl+C.

# The advanced use of Linsk

The example provided above is just a mere preview of the endless power Linsk's native Linux VM has.

## Use LVM

Linsk supports LVM2. You can mount LVM2 drives by specifying `mapper/<device name>` as the VM device name. Let's assume that you want to mount `vghdd-media` you found in the `linsk ls` output above. To do so, you may run:
```powershell
# This should be run in a terminal open with administrator privileges.
linsk run dev:\\.\PhysicalDriveX mapper/vghdd-media
```

## Use LUKS with `cryptsetup`

As well as with LVM2, LUKS via `cryptsetup` is natively supported by Linsk. To mount LUKS volumes, you may specify the `-l` flag in `linsk run` command. Let's assume that we want to access LUKS-encrypted volume `vghdd-archive` we found in the `linsk ls` example provided in step 2. To mount it, you may execute:
```powershell
# This should be run in a terminal open with administrator privileges.
linsk run -l dev:\\.\PhysicalDriveX mapper/vghdd-archive
```

`-l` flag tells Linsk that it is a LUKS volume, and Linsk will prompt you for the password. Combined, your terminal will look like this:

```
# linsk command output

```

This example showed how you can use LUKS with LVM2 volumes, but that doesn't mean that you can't use volumes without LVM. You can specify plain device paths like `vdb3` without any issue.
